# 🏗️ SaaS Hosting Strategy & Template

This document serves as the **Global Standard** for deploying SaaS applications in the AMPA ecosystem. It evaluates top hosting providers and defines our "Golden Stack" for future projects.

## 🏆 The "Golden Stack" (Our Default Choice)

For 90% of our SaaS projects (including `CampaignStudio`), we will use this combination for its balance of **Developer Experience (DX)**, **Scalability**, and **Cost**.

| Layer | Technology | Provider | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14 | **Vercel** | Native Next.js support, global CDN, zero-config deployments. |
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python) | **Railway** | Full-stack PaaS, easy Docker support, persistent volumes, affordable. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | **Supabase** | Managed Postgres, built-in Auth, Realtime, and Storage (S3-compatible). |
| **Auth** | OAuth / Email | **Clerk** | Best-in-class DX for user management (or Supabase Auth as backup). |

## 📊 Hosting Provider Comparison Matrix

We evaluated the following providers based on SaaS requirements (Scalability, DX, Cost).

### 1. 🚄 Railway (Winner for Backend)
*   **Best For:** Full-stack apps (Python/Node), Databases, Cron Jobs.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **"It Just Works":** Connect GitHub, and it builds automatically.
    *   **Monorepo Support:** Handles our `/backend` and `/frontend` structure easily.
    *   **Persistent Storage:** Critical for apps that need disk access (unlike serverless).
    *   **Cost:** Pay-for-usage (very cheap for startups).
*   **Cons:** No native "Serverless Functions" (always running containers).

### 2. ▲ Vercel (Winner for Frontend)
*   **Best For:** Next.js, React, Static Sites.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Speed:** Unbeatable global edge network.
    *   **Integration:** Built by the creators of Next.js.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Backend Limits:** Serverless functions have timeouts (bad for long AI tasks).
    *   **Pricing:** Can get expensive if you hit limits.

### 3. ☁️ Render (Strong Runner-Up)
*   **Best For:** Unified hosting (Frontend + Backend + DB).
*   **Pros:** Simple UI, "Blueprints" (Infrastructure as Code).
*   **Cons:** Slower builds than Railway, auto-scaling is a paid feature.

### 4. 🦖 AWS / GCP (The Enterprise Choice)
*   **Best For:** Massive scale, specific AI needs (TPUs).
*   **Pros:** Infinite scalability, granular control.
*   **Cons:** **Complexity Overload.** Requires DevOps expertise (Terraform, IAM roles) that slows down MVP development.
*   **Verdict:** **Avoid for Phase 1.** Migrate here only when spending >$1k/month.

### 5. 🧱 Databricks
*   **Best For:** Heavy Data Science / Big Data pipelines.
*   **Verdict:** **Overkill** for general SaaS. Use only if building a data lake product.

### 6. 🏠 Hostinger
*   **Best For:** WordPress, simple PHP sites, low-budget VPS.
*   **Verdict:** **Not suitable** for modern CI/CD-driven SaaS apps.

## 🗺️ Deployment Roadmap for Campaign Studio

### Phase 1: The "MVP" Deploy (Current Goal)
1.  **Database:** Create Supabase Project -> Get `DATABASE_URL`.
2.  **Backend:**
    *   Push to GitHub.
    *   Connect Railway to Repo.
    *   Set `ROOT_DIRECTORY` to `/backend`.
    *   Add `DATABASE_URL` env var.
3.  **Frontend:**
    *   Connect Vercel to Repo.
    *   Set `ROOT_DIRECTORY` to `/next-gen-app`.
    *   Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (Railway URL).

### Phase 2: The "Scale" Deploy
*   Add **Redis** (on Railway) for task queues (Celery).
*   Add **CDN** (Cloudflare) for media caching.
